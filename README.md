# Apertium

[classify-symbols.c](https://github.com/GavinWz/Apertium/blob/master/classify-symbols.c) is the previous version, which is wrong because of my misunderstanding of the [Coding Challenge](http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Ideas_for_Google_Summer_of_Code/Robust_tokenisation).    

At the suggestion of mentor Tino Didriksen, I used the ICU and C++ to complete my code.

[classify-symbols.cpp](https://github.com/GavinWz/Apertium/blob/master/classify-symbols.cpp) is the latest version of it. The executable file "classify-symbols" is the result of my compilation on Linux, and there is a picture of the test results of my code.
